# DataPtrSwap-driver
cheat driver using DataPtrSwap for communication 

please ignore my coding style but this was my old coding style 

i have listed comments inside the source for everyone wanting to learn from this code  


I'm releasing due to me no longer having any use to this as i do internal stuff now and this is just laying around my drives taking space
